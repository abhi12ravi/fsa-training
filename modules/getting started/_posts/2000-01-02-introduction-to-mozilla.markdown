## The Mozilla Community

A huge part of Mozilla's success is its community of volunteer Mozillians, coming from different parts of the globe. They are superheroes who allot time to volunteer for Mozilla from contributing code to organizing events, along with balancing their day jobs! As an FSA, you're one of these superheroes who believe in doing good for the Web!
